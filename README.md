## 🔹 Overview

This repository contains a **scalable, cloud‑deployed Product Recommendation System** built using **NLP, deep learning embeddings, and machine learning**. The service is exposed via a **Flask REST API**, containerized with **Docker**, and deployed on **AWS ECS** for reliable, scalable, and real‑world production usage.

The system leverages **semantic search using transformer embeddings** and **FAISS vector retrieval**, combined with a **LightGBM ranking model**, to deliver highly relevant product recommendations in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this system is to:

* Provide personalized product recommendations
* Understand product text using NLP embeddings
* Perform fast similarity search using FAISS
* Rank recommendations using a machine learning model
* Serve predictions through a scalable Flask API
* Run reliably in production using Docker and AWS ECS

---

## 🧠 Model & Recommendation Approach

The recommendation pipeline consists of three main components:

### 1️⃣ Text Representation (NLP Layer)

* Uses **Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM)** to convert product descriptions into dense vector embeddings.
* Captures semantic meaning instead of simple keyword matching.

### 2️⃣ Fast Similarity Search (Retrieval Layer)

* Stores embeddings in **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** for ultra‑fast nearest neighbor retrieval.
* Returns top-K most similar products based on user input or selected item.

### 3️⃣ Ranking Model (ML Layer)

* A **LightGBM model** re-ranks retrieved candidates based on learned relevance signals.
* Ensures business-friendly and high-quality recommendations.
